# Alexandria

Named after the great greek library, this little project aims to help you (but mostly me) keep track of
your media collection.

What it currently does:

Scans your disk for video files

Tells you their names and resolutions





What it should do pretty soon:

Use sqlite to store that and call it back

Be searchable to find out if you still need to download something or not

Maybe at some point have a GUI
